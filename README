THIS PROJECT IS DEAD AND IS BEING REPLACED BY THIS ONE  https://github.com/rippinrobr/hockey-databank 
It contains the CSV files in addition to data and schema backups for SQLite now and soon it will support
MongoDB, MySQL and Postgres

hockeydb
========

hockeydb contains code to load the Hockey Database CSV files into databases for multiple RDBMSs. The database structure is exactly the same as the CSV files
except for the Master.csv file, for the master table I added an id column so I could us it as a primary key.  All other tables mimic the CSV fils.
I've included the Hockey Database README file with the addition of the id column I added to the master table so I could add a primary key to the table.

The Hockey Database README starts below

3.0 NHL data availability

* Regular season +/- was published in the NHL Guide starting for 1982-83.
  Total Hockey has regular season +/- starting for 1967-68.  Postseason +/- was
  published in the NHL Guide starting for 1983-84.

* PPG, SHG, GWG, and GTG were published in NHL Guide for the regular season
  starting for 1963-64, and in Total Hockey starting for 1967-68.  Postseason
  values for PPG, SHG, and GWG are available in Total Hockey starting for
  1967-68, but were not published in the NHL Guide until the 1976-77 season.
  Postseason game summaries indicating PPG and SHG were published in Stanley
  Cup Records and Statistics (1975-76 season and earlier).

  Also note that for 1983-84 and earlier, a GTG was credited to each team in
  tie games.  Starting in 1984-85, only one GTG was credited in tie games.

* Shots on goal for the regular season were published in the NHL Guide starting
  for 1967-68, and for the postseason starting for 1983-84.

* Goalies' shots against for the regular season were published in the NHL Guide
  starting for 1982-83, and for the postseason starting for 1983-84.

* ENG were recorded starting in 1963-64.  The 2nd edition of Total Hockey
  incorporates research on ENG from 1955-56 to 1962-63, and subtracted these
  goals from individual GA totals.  These revised values are NOT incorporated
  in this database.

* Team bench minors were first tabulated in the NHL Guide for the 1969-70
  season.

* Postseason special teams statistics published in the NHL Guide for 1987-88
  and 1988-89 do not include SHGF or SHGA.

* Postseason power play / penalty killing team statistics published in Stanley
  Cup Records & Statistics do not indicate the number of power play or penalty
  kill opportunities.  However, the game summaries in the 1976 and 1977
  editions include "ADV", and these have been tabulated in this database.
